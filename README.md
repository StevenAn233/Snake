一个简单的基于控制台的贪吃蛇小游戏。

目前只支持单人游戏，但应该能较为便捷地改为多人模式。

程序支持人机对手蛇以及包含一个简单的自动寻路系统。

注：
1. 项目在Visual Studio上创建并编写，其他编译器运行时可能出现问题。
2. 程序包含了`windows.h`头文件，只能在Windows系统上编译运行。

This is a simple snake game based on powershell.

Currently only single player mode is supported, but the programme should be easily adapted to a multi-player version.

The programme supports computer opponent snakes, including a simple auto-path system.

Something you should know:
1. The project was created and written on Visual Studio, so there might have been problems while using other IDEs.
2. The programme included `windows.h`, meaning that it can only run on Windows.
